Hub F.A.Q's
=========

This is a list of frequently asked questions.

### What is Hub?

Hub is a network/community utility designed for Hyperboria. It leverages a decentralized node information exchange standard called nodeinfo.json to expose the vast network data to anyone in an accessible and easy-to-use website.

### What are the benefits of using Hub?

Gaining insight into the network, and specific people, nodes or services. In addition, Hub offers a few services and tools you might find useful.

### Is Hub free to use? 

Yes, it is an open source federated project. It will always remain free.

### Can I remove myself from this website?

No. The data collected is publicly collected using cjdns itself, in addition we use the data in various ways to help protect the network from abuse. No publically identifiable information is retained, and if you at some point want to remove any personally identifiable information you personally submitted, you will be able to easily remove it.

### How does a centralized service help Hyperboria?

Accessibility and discovery. Hub is a centralized front-end atop a federated backend that collects information from self hosted (decentralization) nodeinfo.json files powered by an open source code base. The data is open and accessible and the authors have no malicious intentions.

### Can I host my own Hub instance?

Yes! Please do. We have been working hard to make Hub easy to install and maintain. 


### Who created Hub?

DanSup (aka derp) started the precursor to Hub in January of 2012. After nodeinfo was launched by mikey the next month, dansup lost interest. In May 2014, Mikey left and took nodeinfo with him, so a renewed interest was taken by dansup and he started a rewrite called hub. The rest is history as they say.

### What is nodeinfo.json?

A cjdns node information JSON standard, intended to be self-hosted by each node to promote forward thinking privacy. DanSup created the nodeinfo.json spec in June of 2014 during early development of hub after long term planning.
